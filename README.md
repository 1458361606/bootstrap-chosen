![](https://github.com/alxlit/bootstrap-chosen/raw/master/example.png)

An alternate stylesheet for [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/). This
one is supposed to integrate better with Bootstrap.

Chosen widgets take the width of their container. Wrap them with
`<div class="chosen">...</div>`, and optionally add `chosen-mini`
etc.
